# AI-Assistants-for-Egyptian-Syndicates
This project involves developing AI assistants for various professional syndicates in Egypt, including the Engineering Syndicate, Physical Therapy Syndicate, Teachers Syndicate, and more. The assistants leverage OpenAI's API to provide information on healthcare programs, regulations, and other relevant topics for each syndicate.
